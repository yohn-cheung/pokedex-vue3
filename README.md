# Pokedex

## Description

This is a fanmade Pokedex, developed with Vue3 and PokeAPI.

This Pokedex is build with the Quasar framework, a Vue.js based framework which allows me as a web developer to quickly create responsive websites/apps. I use the latest version of Vue 3, making use of the composition API. To share data between the pages and components, I made use of Vuex 4, state management system.

All the content and images is provided by PokeAPI.
